# Image Manipulation

This project is an expirement and playground to test out different ideas regarding the manipulation of image data.

## Contrast Highlighter

This module searched images, finding pixels that highly contrast their neighbors. These pixels are then converted to grayscale, with zero contrast pixels appearing as white, and the highest contrast pixels as black. This process has provided me new insight into how jpegs are processed and stored, and has opened the door into new things for me to test.
